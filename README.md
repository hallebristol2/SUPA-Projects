# SUPA-Projects
These projects were created in 2016 in high school for the Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) Computer Engineering course.
Led by Matthew Harbinger, the course taught fundamental programming and computational math skills using Java in the Eclipse IDE.
This project was transferred to VS Code for publishing.
