# SUPA-Projects
These projects were created in 2016 in high school for the Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) Computer Engineering course.
Led by Matthew Harbinger, the course taught fundamental programming and computational math skills using Java in the Eclipse IDE, except for P_BallArrayList, which was created in Processing V3.

# Goals
LoopLab2 – Master loops by computing factorials, pi, radicals, and square roots of numbers.

P_BallArrayList — Spawn circles in a random color at a random velocity that:
<li>Bounce off of the window edges</li>
<li>Grow when colliding with a circle of a smaller size</li>
<li>Delete when colliding with a circle of a larger size</li>

PirateLab – Understand objects and classes by creating and performing functions Pirate objects such as accumulating loot or losing an eye.

TymeLab – Learn how computers (using Java) understand time by creating and manipulating Tyme objects, such as adding minutes and hours to a clock and calculating how long it has been since midnight.
